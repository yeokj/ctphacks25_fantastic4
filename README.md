For CUNY Tech Prep's Hackathon, we (The Fantastic Four) will create a project like no has ever seen before.

Our project shows the UV index of surrounding transportation hubs (i.e subway stations, airports, etc.) in New York City to determine whether or not an area
is fit for the installation of a solar panel, and to use that energy to power trains to cut carbon emissions.
